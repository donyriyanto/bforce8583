						MultiXTpm Simple System is a prototype application built on top <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;
							text-decoration: underline">MultiXTpm Application Server</span></strong>. Its purpose is to demonstrate the use of <strong>MultiX Simplified API</strong>.<br />
						<br />
						<strong>MultiX API</strong> provides the developer with the ability to develop complex applications that use
						variety of resources and communicate with other applications in different ways
						and protocols.<br />
						<br />
						There are times where the entire MultiX API is too big and complex in order to implement
						simple Client/Server applications, and most
						of the features it provides are not required for the specific requirments, especially when there is a need to
						develop simple client/server applications that usually send messages sequentially &nbsp;in one direction
						and receive responses in the other direction.<br />
						<br />
						For these simple cases, <strong>MultiX Simplified API</strong> provides a simple
						set of functions that enables the development of Client/Server applications
						using as few as 3-4 function calls. This <strong>MultiX Simplified API</strong> frees the developer
						from the burden of learning the entire API before starting the implementation of his/her first applications.

						Building and Using MultiXTpm Simple System.</h2>
Before using <strong>MultiXTpm Simple System</strong> you must do the followings:
<ol><li>Follow the instructions in the <a href="ReadMe.htm">ReadMe</a> file for setting up the <a href="MultiXTpm Application Server.htm">MultiXTpm Application Server</a>
	for <a href="ReadMe.htm#Win32Platform">Win32</a> platform or for <a href="ReadMe.htm#LinuxPlatform">
		Linux</a> platform.</li>
	<li>Once <a href="MultiXTpm Application Server.htm">MultiXTpm Application Server</a>
		is built and setup, change directory to <strong>
		MultiXTpmSimpleSystem</strong> directory.</li>
	<li>Build <strong>MultiXTpm Simple System</strong>:<ul><li>On Win32 platform use <strong>Visual Studio 2005</strong>.</li><li>On Linux platform execute <strong>LinuxBuildAll.sh</strong>.</li></ul></li>
	<li>Once <strong>MultiXTpm Simple System</strong> is built:<ul>
		<li>Make sure you are at the solution directory (<strong>MultiXTpmSimpleServer</strong>).
		</li>
		<li>Execute MakeRuntime, This will create “runtime” directory and copy all executables
						and configuration file to the runtime directory.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>To start the system:<ul>
		<li>Make sure that you are at the runtime directory (MultiXTpmSimpleServer/runtime).</li>
		<li>Execute <strong>MultiXTpm</strong> or <strong>MultiXTpmD</strong> (for debug) (these files are located in the runtime directory of <a href="MultiXTpm Application Server.htm">
				MultiXTpm Application Server</a>). </li>
		<li>You will notice that a new window is opened; this window is where <strong>MultiXEchoServer</strong>
			is running. (on Linux no new window is opened).</li>
	</ul>

	Testing MultiXTpm Simple System</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>
	
	Change directory to the runtime directory (<strong>MultiXTpmSimpleSystem/runtime</strong>).</li>
							<li>Execute <strong>MultiXEchoClient</strong> (with or without arguments).</li>
							<li><strong>MultiXEchoClient</strong> sends it command line arguments to the server one line at a
						time, it prints what it sends and it prints the responses it receives.</li>
							<li>You will notice that when <strong>MultiXEchoServer</strong> receives the requests, it prints the requests
						and when it sends the responses, it prints them as well.</li>
							<li>
	The system is configured in a way that
						if there are more than 5 sessions opened to the <strong>MultiXEchoServer</strong>, MultiXTpm starts another instance of <strong>
									MultiXEchoServer</strong>. Since each session is cleared about 5 seconds after
						the actual disconnect of the client, if you run the client more than 5 times within
						5 seconds, you will see that mre instances of <strong>MultiXEchoServer</strong>
								are created.</li>
							<li>When an instance of <strong>MultiXEchoServer</strong> becomes idle for more than 30 seconds, it is
						terminated by <strong>MultiXTpm</strong>, except for the last one, which is never terminated by <strong>MultiXTpm</strong>.</li>
							<li>If <strong>MultiXEchoServer</strong> instance does not receive requests within a 10 minutes period, it
						terminates itself. In that case, if it is the last instance, 
								<strong>MultiXTpm</strong> will recreate
						a new instance. </li>
