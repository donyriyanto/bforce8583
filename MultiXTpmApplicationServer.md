# MultiXTpm Application Server #

# Open Source/Free Software #

**MultiXTpm** is an Application Server, Message Oriented Middleware (MOM) and Transaction Processing (TP) Monitor. It provides the runtime environment and rich API for developing large, scalable applications that are required to process online transactions originated from various types of computers and devices.
A **MultiXTpm** based system is built from various types of processes that run on one or more machines and communicate with each other using the provided API. Among other things, this API enables the developers to build systems that are based on multiple processes that communicate with each other, rather than build one monolithic program that does all processing of all types of activities.
As an Application Server and Message Oriented Middleware (MOM) in a Distributed Processing environment, **MultiXTpm** provides a system that is as open and flexible as it can be. **MultiXTpm** can provide services to all kinds of applications and hardware devices. It does not impose any restrictions or requirements on any part that is external to the main processes of the system. For example, if there is a requirement to connect a specific POS (Point of Sale) terminal to the system but it uses a specific protocol and data format, in that case **MultiXTpm** provides all the facilities and API to interact with that POS terminal, convert its data to an “understood” format and “inject” the data into the system as it was received from some other internal resource. This flexibility makes **MultiXTpm** the best solution for large scale systems that are required to support a wide range of devices and input methods. This is in opposite to all object oriented application servers that enforce the developers to use a single or maybe two input methods in order to interact with the main application server.
When it comes to connecting to legacy systems and proprietary applications or hardware controllers, **MultiXTpm** provides all the necessary services to:

  * Act as a server to these systems, handle requests and provide responses to these requests.
  * Act as a client to these systems by handling all the protocol and data conversions when sending requests and receiving responses.
  * Act as an Application Level Router/Gateway/Connector between different systems
